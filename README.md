# Product description:
NEXT is a white-label mobile POS product for small and medium businesses in developing countries.

Using our web API merchants are able to integrate in their products instant image recognition.

Using image recognition we are able to instantly recognize items in the user basket, calculate their price
and eliminate the process of marking products one by one by cashiers.

The final result appears on the screen of the cashier's mobile app and he/she is able to correct any items (only if needed).

# Benefits
NEXT eliminates the need to mark retail products one by one.
It also serves as a total replacement for the POS hardware, by replacing it with a client and server application.
